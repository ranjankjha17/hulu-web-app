This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## server side rendering

*** nextjs is server side rendering , suppose user have request https://hulu2-0-web-app-adarsh.vercel.app/ on browsers, so by default the next.js server are installed on my browsers and when users request our website on browsers, so the next.js render the require data with help of props with help of javascript, this means users are seen are page very immediately. ***

*** next js convert yout jpg,png image into webp on server to fetch image on client side immediately and only deliver the image size file for the device you want out of the box ***

*** Next js automaticaaly resize the image depend upon your device resolution means #lower resolution image for lower resolution devices ***
#higher resolution image for hight resolution device like 3k, 4k, 5k , 12k, which is awesome ***
